We got an assignment in the JavaScript3 course to make an application using React and Firebase. In the App you should be able to create users with Firebase authentication system as well as get and store data in the Firebase realtime database. 
I chose to create a drink database. When a user is logged in he or she will be able to search after drinks based on different criteria, mark drinks as favorites and leave comments. I got the data from an API on [The CocktailDB](http://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

Technologies I've used:
  - React
  - Firebase
  - JavaScript ES6
  - HTML5
  - Bootstrap
  - Sass

Features that could be added to the application:
   - Add your own drink
   - Likes
   - Searchfield for specific drink
