We got an assignment in the JavaScript course to make an application using React and Firebase. In the App you should be able to create users with Firebase authentication system as well as get and store data in the Firebase database. I chose to create an App with different drinks. When a user is logged in he or she will be able to mark drinks as favorites and leave comments. The drinks I got from an API on [The CocktailDB](http://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

Technologies I've used:
  - React
  - Firebase
  - JavaScript ES6
  - HTML5
  - Bootstrap
  - Sass (still to be added)

Features that could be added to the application:
   - Add your own drink
   - Likes
   - Searchfield for specific drink
